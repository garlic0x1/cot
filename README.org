#+TITLE: The Coalton Omnipotent TUI
#+AUTHOR: garlic0x1

* Overview

I am just doodling around functional TUI ideas, I have built a small
game with this for personal use.

* Concepts

Components implement the ~Drawable~ class with a function that accepts
a bounds to draw within, and container components recursively call
~draw~ on their children.

* Examples

Some basic examples are included in [[./example.lisp]], and you can try
them with ~make example && ./example.exe~

#+begin_src lisp
  (Frame
   (Border (Modeline "Example 1 - Basic Layout")
           (Modeline "<Space> - Cycle : <q> - Quit")
           (Margin 0)
           (Margin 0))
   (HSplit
    (the Integer 16)
    (Centered "16 chars wide")
    (VSplitLine
     1/3
     (Centered "1/3rd of vertical space")
     (Centered "rest of space"))))
#+end_src

#+begin_src lisp
  (Frame
   (Border (Modeline "Example 2 - Negative Layout")
           (Modeline "<Space> - Cycle : <q> - Quit")
           (Margin 0)
           (Margin 0))
   (HSplit
    (the Integer -20)
    (VSplitLine
     -1/5
     (Centered "rest of space")
     (Centered "1/5th from bottom"))
    (Centered "20 from right")))

#+begin_src lisp
  (Frame
   (Border (Modeline "Example 3 - Overlapping Layout")
           (Modeline "<Space> - Cycle : <q> - Quit")
           (Margin 0)
           (Margin 0))
   (Overlapping
    (Frame
     (Border (Margin 8) (Margin 8) (Margin 8) (Margin 8))
     (OpaqueFrame (Border (Modeline "Modal") Line Line Line)
                  (Centered "OpaqueFrame covers the rest!")))
    (VSplit 1/2
            (Centered "TOP TEXT")
            (Frame (Border Line Line Line Line)
                   "BOTTOM TEXT"))))
